Fragmenter
==========

Fragment a hard disk for test purposes

Yes, you read right.  Fragment a hard disk.

This code will allow you to fragment a hard disk so you can compare disk transfer speed, input\output (IO) stats snd anything else you may wish to play around with.

Because I am on a 'freebee', you will have to create the files yourself, but the scripts and instructions should help.
